<h2>Casheir at Popular Book Store</h2>

<p>I have two working experience before I continue my degree journey. After I finish my diploma in Accounting, I work as a part time at a book store in Melaka which is as a casheir at popular book store in Mahkota Parade. I love this job because it is first time for me work and i also like the working enviroment because most of the staff are Chinese and the manager also Chinese. Even we are from different religion, but the staff like a family and this is my first time to have other religion freinds.</p>

<h2>Barista of Starbuck</h2>

<p>After 2 month gains experience as a casheir, then I started my new work as barista of Starbuck at Dataran Pahlawan. For me, this job are quiet difficult to compare with the first job because i need to remember all the step making Starbucks drink. Unluckily I never bought any Starbuck drink and do not know how to order it before this. So at first I need to remember drink name and type then I starting learnt to make Starbuck drinks. I love enjoying this job because from this job I learnt how to handle many types of people from another country such as from Chinese, Korea and other country.</p>
